## Think chess.com but for rap battles
--------------------
My ambitious personal project. 
*Other* rap battle applications use prerecorded video. **Boo! That's boring!**
My application uses real-time video for maximum immersion in your rap-battle.

Still a work in progress... but coming along well!
